# Building Serverless Apps with JAMStack and Eleventy

This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course **Building Serverless Apps with JAMStack and Eleventy**. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-serverless-apps-with-jamstack-and-eleventy/).

JavaScript, APIs, and prebuilt markup. Itâ€™s called the Jamstack and it's all you need to build a serverless app. The templating and clean basic architecture make it easier to build applications without reinventing the wheel, while retaining the flexibility you need to handle data from a wide variety of sources. Combined with the static site generator Eleventy you have an even more efficient way to create and deliver serverless apps and websites. In this course, instructor Ray Villalobos takes you through a step-by-step project built with the Jamstack and Eleventy. Learn how to build pages from Eleventy templates and layouts, connect to site data through APIs, use features like shortcodes and filters to inject and update content, and group content in collections. Plus, learn how to use pagination to regroup pages and add navigation with plugins.

## Instructions

This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches

The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `master` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
