The **JAMStack** is part of a family of techniques for creating sites called `serverless`, but those techniques can be a bit confusing.

In this course I'm going to show you how to create serverless sites using a static site generator called **Eleventy** and help you demystify the JAMStack.

We'll talk about what serverless is and why it can be faster and more secure than working with regular websites. We'll explore a **node.js** based platform called Eleventy that gives you a fantastic engine for creating JAMStack sites and apps.
